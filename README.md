# Cadesim server

## Dependencies:
- [Netty](https://netty.io/)
- [Apache Commons CLI](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-cli/)

## Eclipse config
- Use the gradle import wizard and folder Cadesim

Otherwise manually:
- Import from filesystem (not existing project), use folder "Cadesim\Server"
- Entry point: Cadesim\Server\src\com\benberi\cadesim\server\service\GameServerBootstrap.java
- Change .classpath entries to where you installed Netty/Commons CLI
- Set src as source dir and clean,rebuild

## Exporting
- Export as jar through your favorite IDE, extract dependencies.
- or use gradle to export as jar: ```gradle :server:dist```

## Running
start with commandline: ```java -jar cadesim-server.jar <args>```

E.g.: to start several servers with different ports via commandline, and schedule automatic in-place updates:
```
java -jar cadesim-server.jar --schedule-updates 04:00 -p 2345
java -jar cadesim-server.jar --schedule-updates 04:00 -p 2346
java -jar cadesim-server.jar --schedule-updates 04:00 -p 2347
```

Specify round and turn times too:
```
# 30s turn, 10m round
java -jar cadesim-server.jar --schedule-updates 04:00 -p 2345 -t 30 -r 900
```

For full usage call with ```--help```.

Additional developer options can be added at compile-time.

## Releasing
- modify any desired files before release
- use gradle (>6) to release: ```gradle release``` (also builds client).
    - this requires you to have bash in ```%PATH%``` if building on windows.
- For more details on the process see ```build.gradle``` and ```build-release.bash```.
